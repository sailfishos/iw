Summary    : A nl80211 based wireless configuration tool
Description: |
    iw is a new nl80211 based CLI configuration utility for wireless devices.
    Currently you can only use this utility to configure devices which use a
    mac80211 driver as these are the new drivers being written - only because most
    new wireless devices being sold are now SoftMAC.
